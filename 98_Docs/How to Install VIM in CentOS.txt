How to Install VIM in CentOS


http://apetec.com/linux/installvim.htm


You need to manually install VIM on a system running CentOS.

Vim, or VI enhanced, is the successor of the famous vi editor which is found almost in every Linux distribution even on a recovery environment and has some nice features like syntax highlight for files and other useful stuff.

To install it and use in CentOS all you have to do is input the following :

yum install vim-X11 vim-common vim-enhanced vim-minimal

Once done you can enjoy the full benefits of a full featured and very powerful text editor.

Configuration

vim is a highly configurable editor, and it is best to configure vim to your liking as vim by default has all the nice features turned off. It will read the file .vimrc in your home directory before it starts (~/.vimrc).
